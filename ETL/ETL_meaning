# ETL Process

The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process is crucial in data management. It involves three main stages: Extract, Transform, and Load. Below is a breakdown of each phase.

## 1. Extract

During data extraction, raw data is copied or exported from source locations to a staging area. Data management teams can extract data from a variety of different sources, which can be structured or unstructured. The types of data sources include, but are not limited to:

- **SQL or NoSQL servers**
- **CRM and ERP systems**
- **JSON and XML**
- **Flat-file databases**
- **Email**
- **Web pages**

## 2. Transform

In the staging area, the raw data undergoes data processing. Here, the data is transformed and consolidated for its intended analytical use case. This phase of the transformation process can include:

- **Filtering, cleansing, aggregating, de-duplicating, validating, and authenticating the data.**
- **Performing calculations, translations, or summarizations** based on the raw data. This can include:
  - Changing row and column headers for consistency
  - Converting currencies or other units of measurement
  - Editing text strings, and more.
- **Conducting audits** to ensure data quality and compliance, and computing metrics.
- **Removing, encrypting, or protecting data** governed by industry or governmental regulators.
- **Formatting the data** into tables or joined tables to match the schema of the target data warehouse.

## 3. Load

In this last step, the transformed data is moved from the staging area into a target data warehouse. Typically, this involves:

- An initial loading of all data
- Periodic loading of incremental data changes
- Full refreshes to erase and replace data in the warehouse (less often)

For most organizations that use ETL, the process is automated, well-defined, continuous, and batch-driven. Typically, the ETL load process takes place during off-hours when traffic on the source systems and the data warehouse is at its lowest.
